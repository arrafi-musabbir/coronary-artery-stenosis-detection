# coronary-artery-stenosis-detection
Using Faster RCNN with 'inception resNetv2' as backbone architecture to detect stenosis regions within coronary artery from coronary CT angiography.

I followed this publication by Danilov et al. namely [Real-time coronary artery stenosis detection based on modern neural networks](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-87174-2)[^1] to detect stenosis region of coronary artery. Here the authors showed a brief comaparison between eight object dection architectures in coronary stenosis detection. Within them faster RCNN scored the highest. 

# Methodology
I utilized the object-detection-API by tensorflow to train our model and detect stenosis region of coronary artery.
